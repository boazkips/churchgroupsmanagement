## Key Features

### User Authentication and Authorization
The app ensures secure user authentication, allowing different officials to log in and access features based on their roles. Users are authenticated to guarantee that only authorized individuals can perform specific tasks within the app.

### Role-Based Access Control
Each official, including chairpersons, vice chairpersons, secretaries, vice secretaries, treasurers, vice treasurers, and organizers, has designated responsibilities. The app enforces role-based access control, allowing officials to perform tasks related to their roles. For example, secretaries can create and manage documents such as meeting minutes and calendars, while treasurers handle budgets and expenditure-related documents.

### Document Management
The app provides a seamless platform for managing various documents, including meeting minutes, calendars of events, group activity reports, budgets, expense requisitions, and expenditure returns. Officials can create, upload, and edit these documents within the app. Documents can be saved as drafts, enabling officials to work on them offline and upload them when ready.

### Workflow Automation
The app automates the approval workflow, allowing officials to submit documents for review. Once a document is uploaded, relevant officials such as chairpersons, treasurers, and patrons receive notifications to review and approve the document. They can provide comments and suggestions, which the responsible secretary or treasurer can address before final submission.

### Real-Time Analytics and Notifications
The landing screen displays real-time analytical statistics, indicating pending tasks, notifications received, and overall progress. Officials can stay updated with the status of documents and tasks through intuitive visualizations. Notifications alert officials about pending approvals and new documents, ensuring timely actions.

### Offline Support and Cloud Sync
The app offers offline support, enabling officials to work on documents even without an internet connection. Draft documents can be saved locally on the device and synchronized with the cloud-based server when online. This seamless integration ensures data consistency and accessibility.
